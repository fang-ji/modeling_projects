## Background
Many plants cannot survive without their insect pollinators; understanding which particular mechanisms keep the interactions between plants and pollinators mutualistic is crutial for maintaining biodiversity. In some systems (such as yucca - yucca moth, senita cactus - senita moth), plants benefit from pollination but there are costs through the consumption of seeds by the pollinators, while the insects benefits from seed resources. The costs to the insects is through punishment should the insects not pollinate enough flowers or lay too many eggs. This project focuses on the case of random-punishment strategy where plants randomly drop their flowers and developing fruits to prevent cheating when insect activity is high. A series of stage-structured models are used to examine how and under what ecological conditions random punishment can be an effective punishment strategy to limit over-exploitation and maintain mutualism.

This schematic shows the annual progression of plants and insects. Following survival and recruitment from the previous year, plants produce flowers, and pollinated flowers produce seeds. Adult insects pollinate flowers then lay eggs. Eggs hatch into juveniles that must feed on seeds to survive and grow. If the population average insect juvenile load is too high, plants randomly drop flowers as a punishment mechanism to prevent over-exploitation.
